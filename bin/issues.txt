ConcurrentModificationException when trying to input a new string of text while the 
map / list is being iterated, currently resolved with a try/catch but would like to see about
properly implementing it so the "pow" text can be used the way I want.

Currently the 'reach' bounds boxes don't swap when facing the opposite direction. This can likely be 
implemented by simply placing a check during update to see if the direction has swapped and then 
set the location either to the centerX, centerY of the entity or to centerX - width (of the reach bounds).

Need to work on perspective of sprites (man-hole, etc.)

movingLeft in Player (for determing offsets of texture sprites) needs to be adjusted. If the player holds both left and
right at the same time it repeatedly changes movingLeft and flickers between right and left sprites.
